## Tasman Tides experiment

This repository contains the code for a work-in-progress study by Ashley Barnes, Manita Chouksey, Andrew Kiss, Andy Hogg and Callum Shakespeare. A draft manuscript is not yet publically available.

The purpose of the study is to run several regional mom6 experiments in the Tasman Sea regon, to investigate the way that the M2 tidal beam there is represented at different resolutions and under different circumstances (eg. smoothed topography, homogeneous density). We're interested in where the energy of the internal tide beam 'goes' in Model World under these different experiments and at different resolutions. How important is topographic scatter, mean flow interaction, shoaling at the shelf or eddy capture? Do the answers change with horizontal resolution?

When this study is submitted I'll make more of an effort to tidy up the code, add more comments and make it more useful.
